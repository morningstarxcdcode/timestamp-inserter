# Publishing Guide for Timestamp Inserter Extension

This guide will help you publish your VS Code extension **Timestamp Inserter** to your GitHub repository and the VS Code Marketplace, ensuring a professional and human-authored presentation.

---

## 1. Prepare Your GitHub Repository

1. Create a new repository on GitHub named `timestamp-inserter` under your account `morningstarxcdcode`.

2. Initialize your local project as a git repository (if not already):

   ```bash
   cd timestamp-inserter
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit of Timestamp Inserter extension"
   ```

3. Add the remote repository and push:

   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/morningstarxcdcode/timestamp-inserter.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

## 2. Package Your Extension

1. Install the VS Code Extension Manager (`vsce`) globally if you haven't:

   ```bash
   npm install -g vsce
   ```

2. Package your extension:

   ```bash
   vsce package
   ```

   This will create a `.vsix` file in your project directory.

## 3. Publish to the VS Code Marketplace

1. Create a publisher account on [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/manage).

2. Install the Azure CLI and sign in:

   ```bash
   az login
   ```

3. Create a Personal Access Token (PAT) with the required scopes.

4. Login to `vsce` with your PAT:

   ```bash
   vsce login your-publisher-name
   ```

5. Publish your extension:

   ```bash
   vsce publish
   ```

   You can specify a version or use `vsce publish minor` to increment.

## 4. Tips for Human-Authored Quality

- Review and personalize your README.md with your own style and examples.

- Add emojis, badges, and screenshots or GIFs to make it engaging.

- Write commit messages and documentation in your own words.

- Respond to issues and pull requests personally to build community trust.

## 5. Automate Publishing (Optional)

You can set up GitHub Actions to automate testing and publishing on push to main branch.

Example workflow file `.github/workflows/publish.yml`:

```yaml
name: Publish Extension

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build-and-publish:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '16'
      - run: npm install
      - run: npm run compile
      - run: npm test
      - run: npx vsce publish
        env:
          VSCE_PAT: \${{ secrets.VSCE_PAT }}
```

Make sure to add your Personal Access Token as a secret named `VSCE_PAT` in your GitHub repository settings.
